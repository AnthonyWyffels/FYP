1) I am using XAMPP to host the database locally. It is a MySQL database. More on it's organisation can be found in the lib file

2) If you want to run the code, do not forget to add the mysql jar file which can be found in the lib file 

3) Only the "health" part of the database has been added, will attempt to add the other parts at a later stage.
